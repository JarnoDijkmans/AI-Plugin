# AI-plugin
## Context and Background
Yooker, based in Hapert, is an agency specializing in custom websites and webshops. The company combines expertise in web design, online marketing, and innovative technical solutions to help businesses succeed online.
During my internship, my project aligned with Yooker's mission to promote innovation and efficiency. The idea for this project arose from the increasing demand for advanced tools to help entrepreneurs manage and optimize their digital presence.

## Goals
The primary goal of my internship project was to develop a scalable AI plugin for WordPress, consisting of a core plugin and four extensions:
- Text generation: Functionality within the Gutenberg editor.
- Image generation: Integration with AI tools for visual content.
- Landing pages: Generating SEO-optimized pages with SEOpress.
- Product descriptions: Automated generation within WooCommerce.
Additionally, the plugin was extended with features such as automatic contract creation and updates. This ensures customers receive a contract immediately upon subscribing and automatic notifications for new versions.

## Scope
The project focused on:
- Developing a scalable and modular plugin.
- Ensuring user-friendliness and privacy.
- Building a foundation for easily adding future modules.
- Leveraging AI within WordPress.
## Out of scope:
- Advanced AI training or developing custom AI models.
- Full implementation for clients, which will be handed over to Yooker after my internship.
